This extension adds direct links to various Flarum actions:

- `/login` will redirect to homepage and open the Log In modal. Additionally, you can pass `?identification=` and `?password=` parameters to pre-fill the login.
- `/signup` will redirect to homepage and open the Sign Up modal
- `/composer` will redirect to homepage and open the new discussion composer box. Additionally, you can pass `?title=`, `?content=` and `?tag=slug` parameters to define the default values in the editor.

Useful for share features or bookmarklets.

If you hit `/composer` while logged out, you will be prompted for login.
If the user does anything else than log in (close the modal or register) it's possible the values in the url get lost.
The user will have to load the original `/composer` url again to get those values back.
